Long Description: 
<br>Design in Software Engineering Jun 2021<br>                                                                
Collaborated with a three-person team to create "Stop the Waste," a website that fights food waste by suggesting meals from leftover ingredients, using the Spoonacular API with PHP's cURL functionality for meal suggestions.
<br> Applied industry-standard software development methodologies like Waterfall and Agile, breaking the project into milestones or "sprints," with a specific focus on building a food themed social media website.
<br>Utilized Spoonacular API with PHP, performed CRUD operations on an admin page, set up a MySQL database, performed testing using XAMPP and resolved HTTP 503 errors for a smooth user experience.
